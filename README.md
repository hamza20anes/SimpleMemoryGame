# Simple Memory Game (Java Console)

## Overview
A simple **Memory Game** implemented in **pure Java (console-based)**.  
The goal is to match all pairs of hidden cards in the fewest number of attempts.

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and class interaction — all without using graphical frameworks or external libraries.
